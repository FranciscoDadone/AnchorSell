  # Upgrade multiplier: is how much the upgrade will cost depending on the money that the anchor
  # gives per hour in the next level.
  # Example: "upgrade-multiplier: 8".
  # Next level reward per hour: 10.
  # The cost of the upgrade will be 80.

  # Pay modifier: this modifies how much money the anchor will give to a player when it pays.
  # The formula to pay a player is:
  # f(anchorLevel, pay-modifier) = (0.1 * anchorLevel + anchorLevel^0.8) * 60 * pay-modifier

  # In the Excel you can modify the "Pay modifier" and "Pay timer" cells only and view the results.
  # Note: pay-modifier accepts decimals too. ie: 0.2
